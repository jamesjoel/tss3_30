            <p class="main-txt">Conference calls are a great way to bring your team together â€“ but their benefits
                don&#8217;t stop there.
                Smart business people from industries of all kinds make conference calling an integral part of their
                day-to-day operations.
                From brainstorming with an overseas team to managing the day-to-day flow of a project, conference calls
                get things done.</p>
            <div class="solutions">
                <h4 class="active">Crisis Management</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A client needs quick turnaround on a project, but key decision makers are away. You&#8217;re
                        racing a deadline when your network goes down. What can you do? An impromptu conference call is
                        the perfect solution when you need to act fast. With no-reservation calling and 24/7 access, you
                        can successfully resolve any crisis, no matter how large or small.<ul>
                            <li>Experience the fastest way to bring together team members from any location.</li>
                            <li>Enable participants to connect instantly with convenient, dial-in access</li>
                            <li>Organize your meeting with a quick roll call of attendees using our teleconference
                                services</li>
                            <li>Use lecture mode to maintain control and make uninterrupted announcement</li>
                            <li>Limit background noise with individual line muting</li>
                            <li>Employ our convenient voicemail services to announce your message to multiple callers
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Avoid Cellular-Network Blockage</h6>
                        During a crisis, blockage can occur on your cell-phone network if too many users are trying to
                        dial out simultaneously. In such cases, it is easier to dial out to a landline. Develop a solid
                        company emergency plan: meet on the conference-call bridge when problems arise!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sales Meetings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Especially in high-profile industries, the travel schedules of sales reps can make it difficult
                        to schedule group meetings. With conference calling, that&#8217;s never a problem. From product
                        training and strategy sessions to account planning and goal updates, your can enhance your
                        team&#8217;s productivity and confidence through regular, call-enabled communication.<ul>

                            <li>Use lecture mode to maintain control and make uninterrupted announcements</li>

                        <h6>Eliminate Cancellation Worries</h6>
                        Sometimes the cancellation or rescheduling of a sales meeting is inevitable. With Eagle

                        are needed.
